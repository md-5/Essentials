Essentials Development Readme
=============================

The official repository is at:
https://github.com/essentials/Essentials

We use NetBeans 7 for development.

Recommended NetBeans plugins:

* Git
* PMD & FindBugs ( http://kenai.com/projects/sqe/pages/Home )

You don't need to import settings.zip anymore, since the format guidelines have been added to the project properties.

Windows users, please read this: http://help.github.com/line-endings/
The default line ending is LF.

To build all jars, select the BuildAll project and build that. You'll find all jars inside the dist/lib folder of the BuildAll project.

If you create pull requests, always make them for the master branch.

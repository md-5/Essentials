Essentials Development Readme
=============================

The official repository is at:
https://github.com/essentials/Essentials

We use NetBeans 7 for development.

Recommended NetBeans plugins:

* Git
* PMD & FindBugs ( http://kenai.com/projects/sqe/pages/Home )

In the root folder of the repository is a file called settings.zip. It contains the code guidelines settings. Open the preferences of NetBeans and import the zip file. Use "Source > Format" before each commit please.

To build all jars, select the BuildAll project and build that. You'll find all jars inside the dist/lib folder of the BuildAll project.
